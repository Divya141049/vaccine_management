# COVID VACCINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is developed to manage Covid Vaccine and Test-related activity through a computerized system which will replace the manual way of handling all the activity. Also, the doctors, pharmacies, patients can have a single medium through which they can manage all the activities safely.

It has major 4 roles: Admin, Patient, Pharmacy, and Nurse. The first one is the admin, who is the root user of this application and will handle all the activity going around like adding an Nurse, adding pharmacy service, viewing and editing the patientâ€™s record, viewing the report, can, etc.
The next role is that of a patient who can take an appointment for the service available, can also view the Test report uploaded by an agent/receptionist. Another role is that of a Pharmacy that can view the appointment list and can start the vaccination by updating the reports etc. The last role is that of an Nurse, who can make a new appointment, can view treatment reports, etc.

Technologies Used: Java, Sprint Boot, Hibernate, HTML, CSS, JSP, and SQL.
